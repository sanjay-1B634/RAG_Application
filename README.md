# RAG_Application

This a FASTAPI RAG web application, where it gives enriched responses by retrieving the documents from external sources. I used Langchain framework, which creates a RAG pipeline. The documents are retrieved from FAISS Vector Database, and Embeddings are created using Hugging Face Embeddings.
